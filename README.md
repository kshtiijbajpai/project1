# AI Farming Hackathon Project

## Project Description
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence to optimize farming practices through data-driven insights. It uses sensors and machine learning algorithms to predict crop health, optimize irrigation, and enhance yield predictions, ultimately aiming to increase farming efficiency and sustainability. By analyzing environmental factors and historical data, the system offers actionable recommendations for farmers to improve their productivity and reduce resource wastage.

## Features
- **Crop Health Prediction**: Uses AI models to assess crop health based on images or sensor data, helping farmers identify diseases early.
- **Irrigation Optimization**: Utilizes soil moisture and weather data to optimize irrigation schedules, ensuring water is used efficiently.
- **Yield Prediction**: Predicts crop yields based on historical data, weather patterns, and soil conditions, assisting farmers in planning harvests.
- **Weather Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes historical and real-time weather data to recommend optimal planting and harvesting times.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing, machine learning, and backend logic.
- **SQLite**: For storing and managing sensor data and project-related information.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn for building and training AI models.
- **Data Libraries**: Pandas and NumPy for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib for visualizing sensor data and predictions.
